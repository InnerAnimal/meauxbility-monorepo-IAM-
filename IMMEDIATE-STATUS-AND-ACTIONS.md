## ⚠️ WHAT WE NEED TO FINISH (30 Minutes)

### DNS CONFIGURATION - This is THE ONLY blocker!

**The Situation:**
- Your domains are managed through Shopify
- Need to either:
  - **Option A:** Update DNS in Shopify (you log in, I guide)
  - **Option B:** Transfer domain management to Cloudflare/Vercel

**Which Domains:**
1. inneranimals.com
2. inneranimalmedia.com
3. iaudodidact.com
4. meauxbility.org
5. meauxbility.com

---

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN (Choose One)

### Option A: Shopify DNS Update (FASTEST - 30 minutes)

**You do this NOW:**
```
1. Log into Shopify Admin
2. Go to: Settings → Domains
3. Share screen OR screenshot what you see
4. I guide you exactly which buttons to click
```

**What We'll Do:**
- Update nameservers to Vercel (ns1.vercel-dns.com, ns2.vercel-dns.com)
- OR add A/CNAME records if Shopify doesn't allow nameserver changes
- Preserve your email (sam@, connor@, fred@, info@)

**Timeline:**
- Your clicks: 15 minutes
- DNS propagation: 2-6 hours
- **GO LIVE: Tomorrow afternoon!**

---

### Option B: Transfer to Cloudflare (Better long-term, takes longer)

**If you want full control:**
```
1. Add domains to Cloudflare account
2. Update nameservers at Shopify (point to Cloudflare)
3. Configure DNS in Cloudflare
4. Point to Vercel from Cloudflare
```

**Timeline:**
- Setup: 1 hour
- DNS propagation: 24-48 hours
- **GO LIVE: November 3rd (your birthday!)**

---

## 💰 COST BREAKDOWN

**Current Status:**
- Vercel Pro: $20/month (already paying) ✅
